# Materials-Particles-v0.0.1

My first materials, particles simulation project, it shows how materials things behaviouring among.

Materials Simulation Project, I took into account some materials like: Fire, Water, Sand, Mud, Ice and Stones.
 *  This Simulator has one specific purpose, show physics of these materials with diffrent proporties, like gravity, mass, overlap objects.
 *  If you want to open this application you must get to /Debug folder and open Materials_Simulator exec file.
 *  I didn't check any physics among these materials, because I needed break to the rest of my mind :D.
 *  In this simulator we've got edges that we can set them the way we like it, enough to drag the black circles.
 *  We can choose materials on toolbar by pressing A or D :)
 *  If we want to use any material, we must use left mouse button and hold it.
 *  I hope this text didn't tire you out :)
 *  PS: I've used David Barr's Graphics Library from Github, called olcPixelGameEngine. WebSite: http://www.onelonecoder.com/

**Edges:**

You can use some materials on toolbar like Fire with random particle velocities and angles.
I didn't interact fire with other materials, because i've got lazy :<

**Fire:**

The next material is water, it's nothing else like some squares with specific RGB colors, that imitates us a water in result.

**Water:**

Third material is sand, it's behaviouring like balls with small radius and a lower mass :)

**Sand:**

Mud instead of only lower mass, has lower gravity too.

**Mud:**

Before the last one we get Ice material, there is no diffrence, between Ice and Water besides the colors.

**Ice:**

The last one is stone, that behaviour like a ball but with the higher mass and gravity too.

**Stone:**

That's all what you have to know,
Have fun :)
