# Materials-Particles-v0.0.1
My first materials, particles simulation project, it shows how materials things behaviouring among.

Materials Simulation Project, I took into account some materials like: Fire, Water, Sand, Mud, Ice and Stones.
 *  This Simulator has one specific purpose, show physics of these materials with diffrent proporties, like gravity, mass, overlap objects.
 *  I didn't check any physics among these materials, because I needed break to the rest of my mind :D.
 *  In this simulator we've got edges that we can set them the way we like it, enough to drag the black circles.
 *  We can choose materials on toolbar by pressing A or D :)
 *  If we want to use any material, we must use left mouse button and hold it.
 *  I hope this text didn't tire you out :)
 *  PS: I've used David Barr's Graphics Library from Github, called olcPixelGameEngine. WebSite: http://www.onelonecoder.com/
